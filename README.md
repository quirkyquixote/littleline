CommandLine - a Poor Man's ReadLine
===================================

This library is a lighter version of GNU readline, originally coded because I
needed it in a context where I wasn't allowed to GPL.

Requirements
------------

Just ANSI C.

Installation
------------

commandline provices a simple cmake script; to build from scratch:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
